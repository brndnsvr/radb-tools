# RADb Client v0.9 - Testing Summary

**Version**: 0.9.0-pre
**Status**: Ready for manual testing
**Testing Runbook**: [TESTING_RUNBOOK.md](TESTING_RUNBOOK.md)

---

## Quick Start for Testing

### 1. Build the Binary
```bash
cd /home/bss/code/radb
go build -o dist/radb-client ./cmd/radb-client
./dist/radb-client version
```

Expected output:
```
radb-client version 0.9.0-pre
Build date: development
Git commit: dev

🧪 Pre-release build - pending final manual testing

See TESTING_RUNBOOK.md for complete testing procedures
```

### 2. Follow the Testing Runbook

The comprehensive testing runbook ([TESTING_RUNBOOK.md](TESTING_RUNBOOK.md)) contains:
- **14 testing phases** covering all functionality
- **50+ individual tests** with pass/fail criteria
- **Documentation sections** for recording results
- **Security verification** procedures
- **Performance testing** scenarios

### 3. Key Areas to Test

**Critical (Must Pass for v1.0):**
- ✅ Authentication with your RADb credentials
- ✅ Route listing and diff generation
- ✅ Snapshot creation and management
- ✅ Secure credential storage
- ✅ Configuration management

**Important (Should Test):**
- Contact management operations
- Input validation (invalid data handling)
- Error handling and messages
- Output formatting (table, JSON, YAML)
- File permissions and security

**Nice to Have:**
- Performance with large datasets
- Concurrent operations
- Platform-specific features

## Recommended Testing Workflow

### Quick Test (30 minutes)
Run these essential tests to verify core functionality:

```bash
# 1. Configuration
./dist/radb-client config init
./dist/radb-client config show

# 2. Authentication
./dist/radb-client auth login
./dist/radb-client auth status

# 3. Route Operations
./dist/radb-client route list
./dist/radb-client route list --format json
./dist/radb-client route diff

# 4. Snapshots
./dist/radb-client snapshot list

# 5. Help
./dist/radb-client --help
./dist/radb-client route --help
```

### Comprehensive Test (2-3 hours)
Follow the complete [TESTING_RUNBOOK.md](TESTING_RUNBOOK.md) for thorough validation.

## After Testing

### If All Tests Pass

Update versions and release:
```bash
# Update version in internal/cli/version.go to "1.0.0"
# Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md status to "PRODUCTION READY"
# Update README.md status

# Tag release
git add -A
git commit -m "Release v1.0.0 - Manual testing complete"
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin main
